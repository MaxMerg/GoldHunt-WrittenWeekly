    <p id="intro">Look for the gold nugget that you lost! Control the square with the arrow keys. Hit the space bar to do a search. <br> If the square turns purple you are very far away from your gold nugget. Blue is a little closer, Teal is a good distance away. <br> Yellow you are very close to your gold. Orange means you are so very close to winning and, Red means you've got your gold. <br> You can only do 7 searches so make sure to spare them.</p>
